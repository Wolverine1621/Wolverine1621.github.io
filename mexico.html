               The concept of immigration is what America was built upon, America's name even was brought from Italy by Amerigo Vespucci, an explorer born of Italy; today our country is split politically and socially as to the fate of immigration policies and strictness, there are regulations, rules, and processes one must go through to even access America or to become a citizen, Mexico and other country's civilians have done extraordinary things to hold the position of "American", including border patrol and the process of naturalization.

            <h2>
              Border Patrol
            </h2>
            
            <p>
              The Mexican Border Patrol is one of the biggest border patrols in the entire world.  With over 21,000 agents it is one of the largest law agencies in the entire world.  The border patrol deports over 400,000 immigrants per year and most of those are Mexicans.  The border control spans over 1989 miles which is just a short 462 miles shorter than the infamous Route 66.  All of these people however were not hired on and put on the border for waste.  They have a mission that is very important and has meaning.  The border patrols mission is to prevent terrorists or terrorist weapons from entering the United States.  This is because of the September 11 events, which changed the way of life throughout all of America.  One of the biggest things that the border patrol does is to prevent illegal drug activities across the border, which is a large part of Mexican immigration.  The border patrol is an important part of the Mexican immigration cylcle and affects greatly this nation.

          <h2>
            Naturalization
          </h2>
          
          <p>
                 The U.S. has harsh laws on immigration and has since the beginning of our country's history, has had laws limiting and even stopping immigration; Although since time has progressed immigration into the U.S. has became increasingly easier. In order to reside here in the United States, you need a green card to work. People can also get into the United States through asylum (political asylum or religious asylum). There is also a naturalization test to become a citizen. This is not an easily accomplished task, due to most U.S. Citizens voting to make it a difficult task (to help restrict unnecessary amounts of migrants). Another aspect of the struggle to become a U.S. Citizen is in the process of border control.

          <h2>
            Conclusion
          </h2>
          
          <p>
            
    Mexican immigration to the U.S., while arguably being both beneficial and detrimental to our society and economy it has been and will always be a part of our history and development.
     Many hear the stories of how immigrants make it too their countries, although they are often unaware of the true difficulties being faced to complete this task, along with the scrutinization of assimilation and abuse from the countries people.
     We would all love to say our country's police force is the most pristine and honorable, however upon entry of our country and through the process of crossing the border these people face extortion; our police force along with Mexico's contains adulteration, the punishment for not giving into this extortion can often be found in deportation from the U.S. or Mexico.

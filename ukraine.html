                Ukraine: A Steep Hill For Its Residents
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                Ever since its independence in 1991 from the formal dissolving of the Soviet Union, Ukraine has lost 7 million from emigration and natural decrease in population. Anywhere from 3-7 million people of this total decrease was from emigration alone. Despite comfortable economic conditions directly after its independence, Ukraine has suffered from an economic crisis whose roots can be traced back to the corrupt policies of President Victor Yanukovych. Some of his most unpopular actions included highly increased taxes, a cut on the funding on aid for Chernobyl incident workers, and him declining an agreement with the EU that would bring the nation into closer ties with NATO. Since then, Yanukovych has been ousted from power. However, to add gas to the flame, Russia annexed the island of Crimea, just south of Ukraine in the Black Sea, from Ukraine which also inspired pro-Russian and ethnic Russians to begin protesting and full on revolt against the current Pro-NATO government. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Now most Ukrainians are displaced and have been affected by the dominoes that have fallen down one after the other in their economic situation. Since the year 2000, Ukraine's population has been shrinking by an average of around 0.7% each year, around 330,000 people every year. Pro-Russians have been heading eastward into Russia, which claims that around 500,000 ethnic Russians from Ukraine have requested passports for either temporary or permanent stays. Then Pro-Western Ukrainians have been heading toward the European Union and NATO member states like Poland, Lithuania, Romania, Estonia, and Lativa. Poland has admitted two thirds of a million *schengens to those coming into the Union. If Ukraine wants its immigration statistics to return, it needs to repair both its economic troubles and the confidence of its current population in their government.
